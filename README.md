## Lab Puzzles:
The goal of each puzzle will be to replicate the look of each puzzle’s image.

   * Starting with [this code](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=FpvaIGZZzA87TUA4) as a base, replicate the above animation.
     
### 3. Your own cool effect!

   * Use one of the provided texture png’s in order to add a screenspace shadow pattern onto the shadows of the scene!
   * Hint 1: What does the "ShadowAttenuation" variable do?
  
Extra Credit:
 * Add some soft interpolation at the edges of your bands, for smooth transitions between color bands. Create a "smoothness" parameter that adjusts the degree of smoothness!
